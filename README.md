# SyncAppAndroid
This android project allows user to sync images from their android mobile devices to their windows computers automatically
using a WAMP server.

Requirements: Wifi Router, Windows Machine, WAMP SERVER pre installed.

Syncapp automatically detects when you connect to a new network and if it's your home network it starts the job to transfer the images
to MySQL server. Which can later be retrieved in the windows machine.

Syncapp can be used by more than one people at a time for a single windows machine.

Syncapp is designed to save users time ehich would have been wasted otherwise to transfer high quality images through a manual
USB connection.
